# ECE601HoloOcean

**Project Definition:** <br/>
At Robodivers, we provide a cross-industry solution to the issue of underwater infrastructure inspection. Our product boosts safety, cuts cost, and is easy to use for your underwater infrastructure inspection needs. Unlike our competitors, who only provide robots capable of inspecting one type of structure, we offer a flexible solution for gathering data on a variety of structures.<br/>

**User Stories:** <br/><br/>
  **Energy Companies:** <br/>
    &emsp;"As an oil company with offshore oilrigs, I want the ability to inspect the integrity of the oilrig without putting any of my employees at risk"<br/>
    &emsp;"As an energy company with offshore wind turbines, I want the ability to routinely inspect my turbines without needing to send a crew out into the ocean"<br/>
    &emsp;"As a gas company with underwater gas pipelines, I want the ability to clean and inspect my pipelines without paying a costly crew of divers"<br/><br/>
  **Civil Engineers:** <br/>
    &emsp;"As a civil engineer responsible for the upkeep of the Hoover Dam, I want to be able to perform routine inspection and identify possible cracks in the foundation"<br/>
    &emsp;"As a civil engineer responsible for the upkeep of the local pier, I want to be able to easily inspect the condition of the pilings before summer"<br/><br/>
  **Military:** <br/>
    &emsp;"As a navy shipyard operator, I want to be able to analyze the integrity of the hulls of ships coming into and out of port"<br/>
    &emsp;"As a submarine captain, I want to be able to inspect the hull of the submarine without surfacing"<br/><br/>

**Minimum Value Product:** A robot capable of traversing a submerged structure and displaying applicable sonar data to the user.<br/>
